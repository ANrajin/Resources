### How to use visual studio for cpp

1. Install the required package from visual studio installer
2. Copy the bits folder from here and paste it to the following location - 

>>>	C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\VC\Tools\MSVC\14.33.31629\include

by default the bits/stdc++.h header file will not be included in visual studio.
Thats why we have added it manually.

Now all set to go...
